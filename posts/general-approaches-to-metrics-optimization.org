* What do we mean by /loss/ and /metric/?
  - the =metric= is what we /want/ to optimize - but we sometimes don't really know how to optimize this, this is just how we evaluate the model in the end
  - =loss= is what the model actually optimizes
* How do you optimize the target metric?
  - In some cases you can just use them (e.g. /MSE/, /logloss/)
  - In some cases you need to do a preprocessing training step with another metric
    (e.g. /MSPE/, /MAPE/, /RMSLE/)
  - In osme cases you need to train on a different metric and then use post-processing during the prediction step
* Early Stopping
  To work around these problems, use two metrics /m1/ and /m2/ and optimize on metric /m1/ while monitoring /m2/, then stop when /m2/ is optimal.
