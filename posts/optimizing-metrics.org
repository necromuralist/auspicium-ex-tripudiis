* Mean Squared Error
  This works, just use it as the optimization metric.
  Sometimes this will be called /L2/ loss.
* Mean Absolute Error
  Once again, this works so just use it.
  Sometimes this will be called /L1/ loss - it isn't as widely implemented.
* Mean Squared Probability Error and Mean Absolute Probability Error
  Some libraries will let you use them as `sample_weights`
  Some libraries (like sklearn) will require you to re-sample the data ~df.sample(weights=sample_weights)~
  Once you re-sample the data you can use any model that optimizes MSE or MAE
