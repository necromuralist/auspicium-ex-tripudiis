* How do you convert text to data?
** Two Main Methods
*** Bag Of Words
**** Vectorization
    This method counts the number of occurrences of each word in the source. For each word it creates a column and then in the row puts the counts for that instance of data.
    + Sklearn implements this with [[http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html][CountVectorizer]]
**** Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency (TF/IDF)
     This method tries to make word counts comparable even if the texts are of different sizes and also to emphasize more important words.
     + Term Frequency: Normalize rows so all values are from 0 to 1 to make texts of different sizes comparable
     + Inverse Document Frequency: Normalize columns to make emphasize more important features
     + Sklearn implements this with [[http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html][TfidVectorizer]]
