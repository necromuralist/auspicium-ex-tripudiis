* A Real World Pipeline
  - What is the business problem that you are trying to solve?
  - What is the formal version of the problem?
  - How do you collect data?
  - How do you preprocess the data?
  - How do you create the model?
    + what is the appropriate algorithm?
    + what is the correct metric?
  - How do you evaluate the model in a real world situation?
  - How do you deploy the model?
    + How do you monitor its performance?
    + How do you update it over time?
* A Competition Pipeline
  - How do you pre-process the data?
  - How do you create the model?
* So, how do you use a competition then?
  - It's good to learn about machine learning
  - It' not just about the algorithms, let the data guide what you do
  - Try to be creative and do things that haven't been done before
